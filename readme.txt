== Description ==
The simple plugin that allows you to display image slides with title, image, author name, date, description and read more linked to posts from selected category. You can order these elements as you wish using drag & drop mechanism. The slide title and description appear with slide-in animation effect.
The user may select categories or other taxonomy items. This widget can also display custom post types.
Number of slides is unlimited and you may specify how many slides you want to be visible in column.
Image sizes available to select from the list are determined at Media Settings of Wordpress. This way the plugin do not have to scale images by itself which is more site optimization friendly solution.
